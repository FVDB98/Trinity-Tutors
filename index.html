                        <p>"I promise Moira's lessons are very enjoyable, helpful and varied. What I like most about Moira as a teacher is her enthusiasm to teach at the same time being supportive to cover my learning needs. I can tell she makes a big effort in order for her students to understand the contents through learning by doing. I think that method is the clue to keep students motivated to continue taking her classes. Strongly recommended!"</p>

                        <p>"I attend online classes taught by Moira, and I can testify that she is an excellent teacher. Before starting I have to admit that I was not very enthusiastic because my level of English is very low and I did not feel very comfortable because I have a sense of ridicule that is too high. But from the first moment I felt very comforted by her, because she is a very empathetic and patient teacher. And above all that she really cares about making herself understood and carrying out tasks to facilitate learning. And very important too, she is so polite, nice and kind."</p>
